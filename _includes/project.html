            We know that in many cases, the information necessary to predict a future stroke is present in medical tests
            undertaken for other reasons, however, often healthcare professionals do not have the time to look for and
            act on this information.

            Moreover, around 30% of the strokes cannot be explained by known risk factors for stroke.

                    higher

                    Council</a>, we are
                currently building a database of anonymised information drawn from health records and medical tests
                libraries of University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust. This will comprise 10,000 people who have had
                a
                stroke and up to 110,000 people who have not. We think this will allow us to generate sophisticated
                estimates of the future risk of stroke at 1,3, 5 and 10 years. Using techniques known as
                ‘explainable
                AI’, we also hope to be able to identify new markers of future stroke, which will may enable new
                treatments to be developed</p>

                involve building new datasets extracted from other UK Healthcare providers and applying the model to
