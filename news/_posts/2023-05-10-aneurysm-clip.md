Some implanted medical devices require additional safety checks before MRI
scans can take place. Automated systems to identify all of these devices could
improve prompt identification, allowing timely safety checks to take place
before a patient attends their appointment.

Our group have previously demonstrated that a neural network based model can
[correctly identify pacemakers with high
accuracy](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10278-022-00663-2).

This additional work accepted for publication in [Journal of Digital
Imaging](https://www.springer.com/journal/10278) shows this approach is also
viable for aneurysm clip detection.
